    "# Tutorial 1: Environment Creation and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show a simple example of how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "Also, we will use this environment to train a policy using [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will be covered:\n",
    "- Creating a [Graph](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html) with an [Object](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/object/index.html)\n",
    "- How to use this [Graph](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html) and a [Bridge](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/bridge/index.html) to create an [Eagerx Environment](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html)\n",
